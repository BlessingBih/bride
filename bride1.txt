the bride was looking beautiful
Marriage is something very difficult for me to understand
Living your parents and start living with someone you dont even know is something really strange to me
I don't know how others see marriage but i have this feeling it not easy
You have to study the person for a long period of time and people do change every day so i dont know how the will cope
I just believe what God can't do does not exist. He made it so for a reason.
